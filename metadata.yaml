description: "Ozma of Oz: A Record of Her Adventures with Dorothy Gale of Kansas,\
  \ Billina the Yellow Hen, the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodsman, Tik-Tok, the Cowardly\
  \ Lion and the Hungry Tiger; Besides Other Good People too Numerous to Mention Faithfully\
  \ Recorded Herein published on July 30, 1907, was the third book of L. Frank Baum's\
  \ Oz series. It was the first in which Baum was clearly intending a series of Oz\
  \ books.\nIt is the first Oz book where the majority of the action takes place outside\
  \ of the Land of Oz. Only the final two chapters take place in Oz itself. This reflects\
  \ a subtle change in theme: in the first book, Oz is the dangerous land through\
  \ which Dorothy must win her way back to Kansas; in the third, Oz is the end and\
  \ aim of the book. Dorothy's desire to return home is not as desperate as in the\
  \ first book, and it is her uncle's need for her rather than hers for him that makes\
  \ her return.\nIt was illustrated throughout in color by artist John R. Neill.\n\
  The book bore the following dedication: \"To all the boys and girls who read my\
  \ stories – and especially to the Dorothys – this book is lovingly dedicated.\"\n\
